In this program, Quilt Library, it will help to create and add new quilts to files 
and be a place to store your quilt information. It also lets you know how many quilts
you have. You can save your quilt library to files and load those files.

(This is similar to the Goals app we worked on, but everything was done from scratch and thought through very well and designed for the Quilt Library by me.)
